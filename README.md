# Arduino-pushbutton-lock-with-servo  
This project uses and arduino and a push buttons to create a keypad. The code for the arduino is made so that you can put a
6 digit password which if its right will execute a command to turn a servo a certain amount of degrees. But if its wrong
the red led will light up and nothing will happen. This code can me modified so if the password combination is correct you 
can make the arduino turn on a motor, turn on some led light, print values to serial monitor, etc... I am not finsihed with
the final project but when I finish I will be posting it.
